                        5. HOW PERSONAL INFORMATION MAY BE DISCLOSED
                    </h3>
                    <p>We may disclose your Personal Information: • To our strategic partners and third-party service providers who provide services such as data analysis, payment processing services, order fulfilment, information technology and related
                        infrastructure provision, customer service, email delivery, credit card processing, auditing and other similar services. • To business partners in the context of a corporate transaction. If ZOGHORI FOUNDATION is involved in a sale
                        or business transaction (e.g., merger or acquisition), ZOGHORI FOUNDATION will retain a legitimate interest in disclosing or transferring your Personal Information to a third party in the event of any reorganization, merger, sale,

                        as Personal Information under applicable law, then we may use it for all the purposes for which we use and disclose Personal Information. In some instances, we may combine Other Information with Personal Information. If we combine
                        any Other Information with Personal Information, we will treat the combined information as Personal Information</p>.
                    <h3> 6. HOW TO ACCESS, CORRECT, DELETE OR EXERCISE OTHER RIGHTS REGARDING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3>

                        Subject Request." We will respond to your request consistent with applicable law. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to the Personal Information associated with the particular email address that you
                        use to send us your request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will try to comply with your request as soon as reasonably practicable. Please note that we may need to retain certain information
                        for recordkeeping purposes and/or to complete any transactions that you began prior to requesting a change or deletion (e.g., when you make a purchase, you may not be able to change or delete the Personal Information provided until
                        after the completion of such purchase). There may also be residual information that will remain within our databases and other records, which will not be removed.</p>

                        use and disclosure of your Personal Information. </p>
                    <h3>12. LIMITATION</h3>
                    <p>Please note that we are not responsible for the collection, usage and disclosure policies and practices (including the data security practices) of other organizations, such as Facebook, Apple, Google, Microsoft or any other app developer,

                    <h3>13. DATA RETENTION</h3>
                    <p>We will retain your Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purpose(s) for which it was obtained and consistent with applicable law. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include: <br>•
                        The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide the Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using the Services); <br>• Whether there is a legal obligation to which
                        we are subject (for example, certain laws require us to keep records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or <br>• Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as
                        in regard to applicable statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).</p>
                    <h3>14. SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION</h3>
                    <p> The security of Personal Information is a high priority at ZOGHORI FOUNDATION. We seek to use reasonable technical, administrative and physical safeguards to protect Personal Information within our organization. Unfortunately, no data
                        transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure.</p>
